**Paper Title**: Transformers Library: A Unified Framework for Pretrained NLP Model Access, Fine-Tuning, and Deployment  
**Author**: Shivanshu Pandey  


## Overview
CE-BERT Lite is an optimized, lightweight version of CE-BERT, a transformer-based model designed for detecting rumors in noisy social media text, particularly on Twitter. Built using the Hugging Face Transformers Library, it addresses the computational and energy demands of large NLP models by employing a two-stage optimization pipeline: **knowledge distillation** and **dynamic post-training quantization**. CE-BERT Lite achieves significant reductions in model size, inference time, and energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for real-time NLP applications on resource-constrained devices like mobile platforms and IoT systems.

## Key Contributions
- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfers knowledge from the high-capacity CE-BERT (teacher) to a TinyBERT-like student model using soft (KL-divergence) and hard (cross-entropy) targets, reducing parameters from ~110M to ~15M.
  - **Dynamic Quantization**: Converts 32-bit floating-point weights to 8-bit integers post-training, further reducing model size and accelerating inference.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Model Size**: Reduced from 420 MB (CE-BERT) to ~25 MB (75% reduction).
  - **Inference Time**: 3.6Ã— faster (0.0124s vs. 0.045s per sample).
  - **Accuracy**: Marginal 1.3% drop (88.1% vs. 89.7% on IMDb dataset).
  - **Energy Efficiency**: Reduced from 0.32 kWh to 0.08 kWh, outperforming models like DistilBERT and MobileBERT.
- **Architecture**: Utilizes a lighter encoder-decoder structure with fewer layers, optimized multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward networks, tailored for edge deployment.
- **Generalization**: Achieves >88% accuracy across datasets (IMDb, Twitter Sentiment140, Yelp Polarity, TREC, SST-2, AG News, Amazon Reviews), with a peak of 95.4% on Yelp Polarity.

## Methodology
- **Distillation**: Trained on soft and hard targets with a weighted loss function, using datasets like IMDb and Twitter Sentiment140. Fine-tuned for 4 epochs, batch size 32, learning rate 3e-5 on Google Colab with NVIDIA T4 GPU.
- **Quantization**: Applied dynamic quantization to compress weights, enabling deployment on low-resource devices.
- **Benchmarking**: Evaluated on accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, inference time, model size, and energy usage using Hugging Face's Evaluate library.

## Results
- **Comparison**: Outperforms DistilBERT (87.0%) and ALBERT (86.5%) with 88.1% accuracy on IMDb, closely trailing RoBERTa (89.0%) and BERT (88.5%).
- **Cross-Dataset Performance**: Robust generalization with 91.18% average accuracy across unseen datasets.
- **Visualizations**: Includes radar charts, heatmaps, and confusion matrices to highlight performance trade-offs (e.g., IMDb confusion matrix shows 881/1000 correct predictions).
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for real-time sentiment analysis and rumor detection on mobile and IoT devices due to its low latency and energy efficiency.

## Significance
CE-BERT Lite bridges the gap between high-performance NLP and resource-constrained environments, offering a sustainable, scalable solution for processing noisy, colloquial text. Its compatibility with TorchScript and ONNX formats ensures seamless integration into production pipelines.

## Future Work
- Extend to multilingual datasets.
- Incorporate privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning.
- Explore advanced quantization methods for further efficiency.
- Enhance scalability for production deployment.

## Availability
- **Data**: Public datasets (IMDb, Twitter Sentiment140, TREC, Yelp Polarity, etc.).
- **Code & Models**: To be released on GitHub for reproducibility.
